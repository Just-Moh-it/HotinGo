# NMS-Project-HMS

## Status: In development
The project is being developed currently.

## Introduction / Tech-Stack
This is part of a IP (~CS) project By Anirudh Agarwal and Mohit Yadav, who have teamed up to create a Hotel Management System using only 
* Python 3.7 for backend
* MySQL for data-storing in remotemysql host
* Tkinter as GUI

## Replicating the project
To run the project in your own computer, first

1. Clone the Repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/SnazzyCoder/HMS-NMS.git && cd HMS-NMS
```

2. Then, install all the requirements using pip (python & pip required):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the project
To start the project, run the file `main.py` in the root directory using python. Type

## Contribution
We do not currently support external contributions. However, you could suggest us what to improve in the next build. When the project will get submitted, there'll be hardly any chances for further deveopment of the software.

## That's It !
You've reached the end (what an achievement). Do let us know how we could improve the system while it is in development phase (heading 2 of this guide).

_Thank You_
